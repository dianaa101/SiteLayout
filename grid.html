                Did you know that a cat’s purring can be a form of self-healing? Cats purr at a
                frequency of 25 to 150 Hertz, which is known to have therapeutic benefits. They also
                sleep for an average of 13 to 16 hours a day, conserving energy for those moments of
                intense play or hunting.

            <p>
                Despite being domesticated, cats retain their natural hunting instincts.
                Whether it's stalking a toy or chasing a laser pointer, their quick reflexes and
                sharp claws make them efficient predators. Even house cats will often exhibit the
                'stalk, pounce, and catch' behavior that is so essential in the wild

            <p>
                Cats communicate in a variety of ways, from meowing and purring to body language.
                A cat’s tail is a great indicator of its mood: a raised tail signals happiness,
                while a flicking tail could mean they’re irritated. They also ‘knead’ with their paws,
                which is often a sign of contentment and comfort
